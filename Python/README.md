# Python

## What about

Python is the first langage I learned in the first year of school.

I saw the beginning of the programming, I discovered : 
- The differents type of variable (Integer, Float, Character, String, etc) 
- The implementation of the data structures (stack, queue, tree, hashmap, etc)
- The principle of recursivity 
- The prelude of module and classes

The last one is the introduction for the next langage I learned : Java.

These project are done with 2 others students.


## What is in it ?

There are two projects (order by date of conception) :
- A Picross game.
- A generator of perfect maze and the resolution of this.


## How launch the project ?

Click on Windows button, search `run`, press Enter, and search cmd to open the shell.

Enter the command: `py <theFile>`
