# Java


## What about

Java is the second langage I've been learning since the second year.

During the second year, I discovered :
- The langage Java and this syntax
- This spefication
- The OOP (Oriented Object Programming)
- The importance of unit tests

And the third year : 
- The OOC (Oriented Object Conception)
- Differents design patterns 
- Differents way to work in the collaborating project


## What is in it ?

There are four projects (order by date of conception) :
- A textual dungeon game.
- A simulation of mail distribution.
- A quizz interface.
- A systeme of dynamic plug-in for a word processor.



## Disclaimer

My code is significantly better comparing to my first year. But these projects 
is on two years so be carreful, some projects are doing were done in the second 
or third year.
Look the date of projects.
